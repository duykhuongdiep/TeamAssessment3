												<p>Personality test results and what are they telling us.</p>

											<h3>What the Myers-Briggs Tests tell us.</h3>
											<p>The Myer-Briggs test shows that the team has a mixture of both ‘introverted’ and ‘extroverted’ people,
												this information allows the team to understand each member’s openness and which team members may need
												more encouragement when it comes to certain tasks. </p>
											<p>The team also has a mixture of people with an ‘intuitive’ and ‘sensing’ personality, this information
												tells the team that we have a mixture of people who both like to learn best by visually seeing and people
												who learn by using thinking of a problem instead, this tells us that certain tasks may be delegated to suit
												each person’s strengths in this category.</p>
											<p>The team has a mixture of ‘thinking’ and ‘feeling’ people, thinking people generally conclude or solve a
												problem based on logic where feeling people conclude based on what best for the team overall. This mixture
												of people can help the team come to multiple solutions to one given problem with extra thought for the
												overall harmony of the team.</p>
											<p>There is also a mixture of people with a ‘judging’ and ‘perceiving’ nature, judging people prefer a planned
												and controlled way of life whereas someone with a perceiving nature prefers to be more flexible and spontaneous,
												this mixture of people could help the team to insure that there is no conflict whilst delegating tasks, a
												judging person may take on tasks that they want to do themselves while a perceiving person will be flexible and
												take left over tasks without strife.</p>

											<h3>What the Learning Styles Test tells us.</h3>
											<p>The overall results of the learning styles test tell the team that a majority of the team are visual learners
												while a couple of the team members are tactile learners, A ‘visual learner’ utilizes diagrams and other visual data
												representations to take in information while a ‘tactile learner’ learns by doing. These results can help the team
												delegate tasks based on what would be best suited for each team member, for example, a ‘visual learner’ may be given
												the task to analyse a spreadsheet with graphs and tables to retrieve information and a ‘tactile learner’ might create a
												physical prototype for the team project or do some field work relevant to the project. The team has no members that
												are predominately an ‘auditory learner’, people who learning by listening. This is a disadvantage to the team as
												whenever auditory learning is required the information gathering will be less efficient. </p>

											<h3>What the Other Tests tell us.</h3>
											<p>
												The Big 5 Personality Test was chosen by three team members; Lewis Martin, Orion Lane and Joshua Barton.
												The results of the Big 5 Personality test further described the personality of all three members, this overall
												helps with many factors relating to team work. The results of a big 5 personality test can help a team by:
												<li>Knowing whether someone is introvert or extrovert will tell a team who may need more encouragement with certain tasks. </li>
												<li>Knowing the emotional stability of a person will help to manage team members work loads and stress.</li>
												<li>Knowing the agreeableness of team members will help to decide important aspect of a team much faster allowing for
													more time spent on the project itself.</li>
												<li>Knowing the conscientiousness of team members will give an indication of how invested a team member is
													with the team work they produce.</li>
												<li>Knowing the intellect/imagination of team members allows the team to get an indication if a team member is
													conventional or imaginative. </li>
											</p>
											<p>Duy Diep chose to do a mechanical aptitude test. A mechanical aptitude test is a test that measures a person’s ability
												to solve mechanical based problems under the pressure of time. Duy scored a 9/10 which is considered a high score. Duy’s
												test results makes him a value asset to the team when it comes to mechanical aspects of the project, for example,
												prototype building or testing.</p>
											<p>Zac Gearing chose to do an emotional intelligence test, this test is used to tell how well you read another person’s
												facial expressions and how well you can link it to an emotion. Zac scored a 15/20, this result means that he was able to
												identify a person’s emotion in 15 out of 20 scenarios. This test result tells the team that Zac would has the ability to
												gauge team members emotions to help better understand how they are feeling about certain aspects of the team work, thus being
												able to improve the harmony within the team. </p>
											<p>Jeremy decided to undertake a creativity test, a creativity can be used to determine an individual’s ability to be creative.
												The results from a creativity test would be helpful when delegating jobs within a team, a person with a higher creativity score
												would be given tasks that required a large amount of creativity and thinking outside the box to complete.</p>
