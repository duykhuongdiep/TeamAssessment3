											<h3>Past team work</h3>
											<p>Overall the group worked harmoniously together with no conflicts with all the team members gelling well
												together throughout assignment 2. Using communication methods such as discord we found projecting our ideas
												and visions for the assignment an easy process. We undertook methods of work that allowed us to work on
												certain aspects of the project independently while at the same time being able to easily share work between
												each other for feedback purposes.</p>
											<p>During the different stages of the project the group was able to share their sections of the assignment via
												GitHub, this allowed the group to keep track of that tasks that had been completed and to check that every
												member was following the same scope of work.</p>
											<p>The final stages of the project involved compiling everyone’s work into the finished project, careful planning
												in the early stages allowed group members to format their work to match the others within group so combining
												everything into the final product was a simple process.</p>
											<p>Overall during assignment 2 the team worked well together, our planning in the early stages of the project
												resulted in the group having a clear understanding of what was required for the project and the effort of work
												that needed to be put forward. </p>

											<h3>Changes to future team work process</h3>
											<p>Since the team worked so well together during assignment 2 we have only implemented small changes to our work
												process, since the work in assignment 3 is must larger than that of assignment 2 we will have multiple team
												members working on the same sections of work, this will involve a lot more collaboration between team members
												to insure work is not being duplicated or drifting away from the intended scope of the project.</p>
											<p>Between the duration of assignment 2 to assignment 3 the group lost a team member, this resulted in each group
												member taking on a heavier workload than previously expected, we implemented a tool from https://doodle.com
												which was used in our case for group members to vote on what part of the project they wanted to take, this
												resulted in a more understandable system of job delegation and a record that the group could look back to
												too insure every part of the project is being covered.</p>
											<p>Since the project was an idea from one individual and not from the team a lot more collaboration with that team
												member is required for this assignment, this means that messaging services like discord that were previously
												used in assignment 2 would become even vital for our group process. </p>
											<p>After the team reviewed the feedback for assignment two we decided to only implement small changes to our way of
												doing technical work. we decided to implement a larger range of technical detail to our project based on this
												feedback and a greater number of visual elements to make the project report less text orientated. </p>
											<p>Overall there is only a handful of changes that the group will implement differently compared to assignment 2,
												this is a result of the group working well together throughout assessment 2 with our group process yielding
												positive feedback on previous work. In conclusion we decided to take a ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’ mentality
												and stick with what was so successful and worked for us in the 2nd assignment.</p>
